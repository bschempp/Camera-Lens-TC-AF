# Camera-Lens-TC-AF
Test some temperature things for Camera-Lens-AF.
The ultimate goal of these tests is to add a temperature sensor to Camera-Lens-AF. Since neither the Canon camera nor the Canon lens has this capability, it will be necessary to add and external sensor. The initially identified sensor is a DS18B20 or DS18S20 3 pin unit. Again, initially, the idea is to run the detector from a Raspberry Pi, which already knows how to handle these sensors. Camera-Lens-AF can then import the temperature from the Raspberry Pi, possibly over a WiFi or Bluetooth connection. This may require waiting for NINA to become Alpaca compatible.
In the meatime, the initial test will be to implement a textbox where the user can enter and update the temperature. This temperature will then be recorded with each image and with each Auto Focus (AF) data set. The AF temperature will be useful to generate a temperature compensation curve. While there is no plan to use the image temperature, it can't hurt to have this information, which will not, by the way, be saved in the image header information but can be saved in the image file name.
